Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address.

Kubernetes provides: Service discovery and load balancing, Storage orchestration, Automated rollouts and rollbacks, Automatic bin packing, Self-healing, Secret and configuration management,

You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images, 

Kubernetes is not a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS (Platform as a Service) system. Since Kubernetes operates at the container level rather than at the hardware level, it provides some generally applicable features common to PaaS offerings, such as deployment, scaling, load balancing, and lets users integrate their logging, monitoring, and alerting solutions. However, Kubernetes is not monolithic, and these default solutions are optional and pluggable.

Does not deploy source code and does not build your application. Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) workflows are determined by organization cultures and preferences as well as technical requirements.
